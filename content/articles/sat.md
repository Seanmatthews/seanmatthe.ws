This might be one of my most frustrating posts to date because I suffered the classic mistake of not backing up my code. So here's your perennial reminder to **ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR WORK**.

In this post, I want to:

* Explain the separating axis theorem to you 
* Demonstrate its use through C++ code

# What Is The Separating Axis Theorem?

# Shape Representation Using Point Clouds

# A Bare Bones Implementation
