```bash
You enter a shadowy stone archway. The exquisite craftsmanship of the ancient masons who built this temple peeks through the centuries of corrosion. Your iPhone LED lights your way toward an empty cyclindrical chamber. On the walls, you make out a series of seven faint, pseudorandomly placed markings. Obvious exits: a large stone archway.
```

```bash
> read first marking
You wipe away the layers of crud from the first set up markings. A written phrase appears: _Single Responsibility Principle_
```

The knowledge of the __Single Responsibility Principle__ has been conferred to you by The Oracle. <insert rest>

```bash
> read second marking
Upon removing the cruft from the grooves that make up this set of markings, a written phrase appears: _Separation of Concerns_
```

The knowledge of the __Separation of Concerns__ has been conferred to you by The Oracle. <insert rest>

```bash
> read third marking
Besides some graffiti, "Η Δήμητρα ήταν εδώ", a clear written phrase is written: _Principle of Least Knowledge_
```

The knowledge of the __Principle of Least Knowledge__ has been conferred to you by The Oracle. <insert rest>

```bash
> read fourth marking
Gross! It's covered in slimy water trickling from above! As you fight lunch back down, you notice a written phrase: _Don't Repeat Yourself_
```

The knowledge of __Don't Repeat Yourself__ has been conferred to you by The Oracle. <insert rest>


```bash
> read fifth marking
You peel away a half-baked layer of clay inscribed with "FIXME". Perhaps a warning or a curse? A written phrase appears: _You Ain't Gonna Need It_
```

The knowledge that __You Ain't Gonna Need It__ has been conferred to you by The Oracle. <insert rest>

```bash
> read sixth marking
You push aside an indecipherable text, labeled with the initials "PHP', that hangs in front of the set of markings. A written phrase appears: _Keep It Stupid Simple_
```

The knowledge of __Keep It Stupid Simple__ has been conferred to you by The Oracle. <insert rest>

```bash
> read seventh marking
A heart has been traced in the dust surrounding a written phrase: _Reasonable Person Principle_
```

The knowledge of the __Reasonable Person Principle__ has been conferred to you by The Oracle. <insert rest>


```bash
Your light is extinguished as your iPhone battery dies. You irrationally feel your way around the circumference of the room. You hope that the tingling on the back of your hand is carpal tunnel, rather than the hundred images of creepy crawlers that flash through your mind in that instant. Suddenly your hand slips off the edge at what must be the singular entrance. You trip into the hallway and continue walking straight until a dim light appears ahead. You increase your pace to a trot, determined to soon check your email next to a steaming cup of Costa Rican El Balar. As you plunge into brightness, the aura of heavy air escapes you and you breathe more easily.

***Congratulations! You have leveled up!*** <yellow text>

> go path
You embark on your long journey back to the Uberland. Along the way, and with every new group you meet, you practice your newfound principles. Though the path proves more difficult than you imagined, and your memories of The Oracle slowly fade, you retain a sense of its guiding truths for software development. As your life eventually grays into the twilight of a waning sunset, the feeling of satisfaction will bubbles up within... satisfaction that that which you've pursued, you pursued well and with earnest passion. 

You're journey is not yet finished! These maxims, which you have discovered, comprise only a countable subset of the innumerable pieces of sage wisdom to be found. Seek them!
