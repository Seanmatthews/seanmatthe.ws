Recently, I thought of a question who's answer I pondered for a little bit. I performed some light Google searches for the answer, but I discovered nothing solid. I wanted to know... what is the generally-accepted taxonomy of the field of robotics?

The field poses some problems in uncovering its taxonomy, not least of which is its multi-disciplinary nature. Robotics comprises primarily mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and software engineering. One doesn't need to look far to see the daily application of these proficiencies in robotics. But other areas, too, often cross the boundary into robotics research and application. Biomimetics, for example, brings us biologically-inspired robotic designs that aim to mimic not only nature's design, but the efficiency and elegance with which nature's designs solve the complex problems associated with navigating a potentially dangerous existence. Neuroscience helps us understand how our brain represents the perceived world and tackles complex problems based on that representation. Other research avenues in this area explore the language of the brain and how to interface it directly.
