This website is auto-generated and statically-served, on a Digital Ocean droplet, using
the Hugo website generator in conjunction with a GitHub webhook and a simple PHP script.
In this article, I'll describe every step toward duplicating my setup. Consider, however,
that this guide was created on {{ .Date }}, and that it may be outdated by now. Also,
consider the versions of all components:

  * hugo 0.37
  * nginx 1.10.3
  * DigitalOcean Ubuntu 16.04 1vcpu-1gb
  * PHP 7.0.25
