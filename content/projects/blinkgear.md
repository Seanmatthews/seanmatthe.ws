I founded BlinkGear, along with two partners, in 2010. My grandiose idea was to implement "real avatar gaming", where users remotely control mobile robots through a web-based PC game layer. The gaming layer introduces gaming mechanics, while the real robots offers a tangible experience. We identified three key technologies that this idea would advance: a small and cheap network interface for mobile robot control, efficient video transmission, and a control system that achieves a reactive feel despite potentially-delayed feedback. During the time we dedicated to BlinkGear, we managed to solve the the first of these by creating BlinkRC, the first WiFi-enabled general purpose I/O board of its kind. Here's BlinkRC featured in Make Magazine:

BlinkGear produced and sold thousands of units, both individual sales and wholesale, over two hardware designs. At some point, the fun had to end.
