Born out of my insatiable desire to explore the unknown, I wanted to apply my robotics expertise to exploring one of the last great tome of mysteries on our planet-- the ocean. To that end, I assembled a team of some of the best engineers I know to create an autonomous underwater vehicle. _Rowboat-1_, born in Brooklyn, NY, is a robot first tasked with exploring the ocean floor, just off the South Brooklyn coast, in an area once known as the [Diamond Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_H._Kroehl#Diamond_Reef).
