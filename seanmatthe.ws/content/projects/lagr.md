# LAGR

{{< figure src="/img/lagrrobot.jpg" >}}

The Learning Applied to Ground Vehicles (LAGR) program aimed to push the limits 
of autonomous ground navigation. I participated in a DARPA-funded follow-on to
the project where the robot performed two tasks: 1) obstacle and crowd aversion,
and 2) human target following. Both tasks used single-scan lidar as the primary
means of perception.
